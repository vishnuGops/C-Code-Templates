Definition: a tree data structure is which each node has at most 2 children.
 which are reffered as left and right child.
 Root is the starting or the top most node and the nodes with no children are called leaf node.


What all data do we need to initialize: Data structure
    value - value of node
    left - pointing to empty address
    right - pointing to empty address

Tree traversals: to traverse through large data quickly and efficiently. 

work : print the node
then move

Pre-order: work -> move left -> move right
in-order: move left -> work -> move right
post-order: move left -> move right -> work 

height or depth of tree: Distance from the root node to the last leaf node


Balancing the tree: height difference between left and right children is at most 1

number of nodes: O(branching factor ^ height)


Determining the height of the tree : depends if the tree is balanced or not

    if tree is balanced, then height is simple logarithmic to the number of 
    nodes in the tree

    height: O(log N) for balanced and up tp O(N) for unbalanced

Binary DFS Template:

    Base Case : Prevent function from recursing infinitely. what to do when we get to leaf node
    Recursive call : Question: Top down process - what is general recirsive call
                     Answer: Bottom up process - what we need to return back up

 


Pathrise Binary Tree: Introduction

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two 
children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

The key concept weâ€™ll be discussing in this pre-workshop is the idea of a 
Binary Tree as a Recursive Data Structure. The reason behind this is that 
many questions involving Binary Trees, boil down to a recursion problem, due to 
their structure.

Recursive data structure: A recursive data structure can be defined as a structure 
which is composed of smaller/simpler versions of the same data structure. In the case
of Binary Trees, at a particular node, the left and right subtrees are instances of 
smaller Binary Trees, that together make up the entire Tree.
