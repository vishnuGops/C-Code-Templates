Binary Search

Trigger word: Sorted ascending, search, find

Time complexity: log n (n= no of elements)
                faster than O(n)

if given a set, its faster than binary search. But not faster if we gotta insert elements into set

int l = 0;
int r = arr.size() - 1;

right limit is set to size -1 which is the index of the last elements

int mid = (l + r) / 2 -----> l + (r - l) / 2;

when 2 numbers added they can be large number causing buffer overflow
so we can do l + (r - l) / 2 to avoid that


Left and right bound will be interchanged and this causes array out of bound error
Left increments if the greatest number doesnt exist

fix: make sure Left and right bound do not cross over each other

while ( l <= r) ------> while(l +1 < r)
left = mid + 1 -------> left = mid
right = mid -1 -------> right = mid
